    <h1>What is Sovereign Cyborg?</h1>
    <p>Sovereign Cyborg is a news aggregator for those who want to engage with technology without giving away more of their personal power than necessary. The articles range from highly technical to very simple, and from practical to purely speculative. They will primarily focus on peer-to-peer systems, especially those that may play a role in bringing us into a post-scarcity world. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3D printing</li>
        <li>Cryptocurrencies</li>
        <li>Open source software and hardware</li>
        <li>P2P alternatives to software on centralized servers</li>
        <li>Seed banks</li>
        <li>Alternative energy sources</li>
        <li>Alternative housing solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sovereign Cyborg itself is open source and can be forked on <a href="https://github.com/ryepdx/sovereigncyborg">Github</a>.</p>
